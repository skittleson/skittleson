ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Spencer

As a software engineer with a wealth of experience in software development and database design. I am well-versed in a wide range of modern computer languages, with a particular focus on .NET technologies. My expertise extends to building and scaling systems to work seamlessly across multiple platforms, with a strong emphasis on testing and ensuring the success of my fellow developers.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I am also deeply passionate about a variety of technology-related hobbies. I enjoy experimenting with 3D printing, working with Raspberry Pis and microcontrollers, and exploring the world of self hosted home automation. I also enjoy organizing and hosting hackathons, providing an opportunity for others to share in my passion for technology.
